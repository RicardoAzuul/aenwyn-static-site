# Static site for my Elven Beguiler, Aenwyn

I created a very basic static site to enhance my Dnd 3.5 experience. Spellcasters tend to be quite complicated, with all the spells they need to keep track of, so I decided to try and make a simple website that could help with that, by having the spell lists available online as well as other necessary info for spellcasting.
