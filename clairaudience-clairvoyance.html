    <p>Clairaudience/clairvoyance creates an invisible magical sensor at a specific location that enables you to hear or
        see (your choice) almost as if you were there. You don’t need line of sight or line of effect, but the locale
        must be known—a place familiar to you or an obvious one. Once you have selected the locale, the sensor doesn’t
        move, but you can rotate it in all directions to view the area as desired. Unlike other scrying spells, this
        spell does not allow magically or supernaturally enhanced senses to work through it. If the chosen locale is
        magically dark, you see nothing. If it is naturally pitch black, you can see in a 10- foot radius around the
        center of the spell’s effect. Clairaudience/clairvoyance functions only on the plane of existence you are
        currently occupying.
